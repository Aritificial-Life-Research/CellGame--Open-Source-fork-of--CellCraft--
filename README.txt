This game consists of code, data, images, and audio. 


All of the game's art and audio assets, with the exception of the music tracks,
are under the license described in ASSET_LICENSE.TXT - you can basically do
anything with them as long as you share your changes.

The game's music tracks are under the license described in MUSIC_LICENSE.TXT -
you can share and copy them, but not make modifications or use them for 
commercial purposes.

Everything else is under the license described in CODE_LICENSE.TXT - it's the
GPL 3.0.

In layman's terms, this game is fully open source, including for commercial purposes,
with the exception of the Music Tracks. Our musician will allow you to use those in
your version of the game ONLY if it's non-commercial and if you attribute him. 
If you replace the music tracks
you can do pretty much whatever you want.

The only other restriction is that if you make any changes, you also have to share those
changes, regardless of whether you are using this for commercial purposes or not.

Read each license for attribution information.
